In this project, I took an existing HTML and CSS outline, and streamlined it so that all images rendered properly with the outline of the webpage. 

I used semantic elements where I thought it would be appropriate, as well as added alt attributes to each image tag.

I conformed the code to provide a more logical and neat pattern, as well as made use of footer and header tags.
